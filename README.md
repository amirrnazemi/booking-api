## Booking API

A clean and production-ready backend service for managing reservations, built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**.

This project provides a full reservation management system, including:

* User authentication (JWT)
* Role-based access control (Admin / User)
* Services & time slots management
* Preventing double bookings
* Querying reservations with filters & pagination
* Secure, modular, scalable architecture
* Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
* Clean folder structure (controllers, services, routes, middlewares)

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a **real-world backend architecture** suitable for commercial applications such as scheduling apps, booking systems, clinics, salons, or rental platforms.
